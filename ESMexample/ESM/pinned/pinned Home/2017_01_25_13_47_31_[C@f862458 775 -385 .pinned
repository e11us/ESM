remember that when your still in school, you think that once I get to a 
holiday, I can fully focus to do ES, not worrying about anything else.
but the truth is that, you learn to dance in the rain, not waiting for storm 
to pass.
the worries will be there as long as you are feeding it. the time to do 
great work is now.
